### Email Sheets Table
A Google Apps Script program to email the user's current selection as an HTML table from a Google Sheets file.

##### Instructions: 
1. In a Google Sheets file, go to Tools --> Script Editor. 
2. Copy and paste each of the .gs files included in this repository. Click Save upon completion.
3. The program will automatically run upon refreshing the Spreadsheet's page, appearing as the final tab in the tool bar.
4. Set information for the email by going to Email Table --> Edit Email Properties. These properties persist after the Spreadsheet is closed. 
5. Select at least two rows and two columns, then go to Email Table --> Send Table. You will be asked if there is a header; if so, the top row will be bolded in the chart that gets sent to the emails you've set under Email Properties.
6. If the information in Email Properties is valid, an email with the chart will be sent!

<sup>1</sup> You will likely be prompted to give the program permission to send an email as you, and to edit your spreadsheets; please note that this program does not feature the capability to edit your spreadsheets, only to send them in an email from your alias.
